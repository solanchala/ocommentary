{{< quote hashtags="FacebookUnblock_OLA" >}}Eviction of Oromos, burning of crops on field, burning of homes who resisted eviction & killings of Oromos started since the 1st invasion of the Sovereign territory by Menilik in the 1890s. Abiy Ahmed reinvented it! pic.twitter.com/HL0SNrtXaz

{{< quote hashtags="OLA_is_A_Resistance_Force" >}}Abiy Ahmed has eroded the good will of the resistance that allowed him to take power to facilitate free & fair election. #OLF_OLA program is clearly written on OLF party program since its creation in the begging of 1970s pic.twitter.com/ObDDIBezkW

{{< quote hashtags="OLA_is_Oromo, FacebookUnblock_OLA" >}}If @Facebook is going to have its way & #OLF_OLA is banned from Facebook, soon, no Oromo will be able to use Facebook as OLA/OLF is inextricably linked to every single self-respecting Oromo person alive today. pic.twitter.com/24Z88Vry0c

{{< quote hashtags="Facebook_Unblock_OLA" >}}Abiy Ahmed came to power on the sacrifices of #OromoProtests but he incarcerated Oromo youth (Qeerroo & Qarree) in denial of who brought him to power. They had no means left than raise arms in the name #OLF_OLA/#ABO_WBO. pic.twitter.com/24Z88Vry0c

{{< quote hashtags="OLA_is_Oromo, Oromo_is_OLA, FacebookUnblock_OLA_Leaders" >}}#OLA/#WBO is a political group championing for Oromo cause as a result of a century old grievances 60+ million Oromo in Ethiopia have. Denying OLA a voice is stifling the voices of 60M people. pic.twitter.com/HL0SNrtXaz
