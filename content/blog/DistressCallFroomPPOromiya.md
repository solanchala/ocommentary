A distress call from  a high ranking official about the PP meeting.
The trio (Lamma, Tayeba and Milkessa) were summoned to appear at the ODP CC meeting (though there is no such a thing as OPP CC). Lemma and Milkessa ignored the invitation. Tayeba attended the gimgema reluctantly. At the meeting, she was searched and dehumanized.  The entire session was literally about four people (under the guise of cleaning the house of fifth columnists and correcting discipline issues). The fourth person is the deputy mayor of Finfinne. 
The trio were accused of everything under the sun: Association with Jawar; working with opposition and Bandas (OLF and OFC) to undermine PP; plotting a coup under the guise of Gaaddisa Hoggansa Oromoo; organizing Qeerroo in Shashamane (TH) to burn the city to the ground and to attack minorities; working with TPLF; lack of discipline, etc, etc.
Abiy now wants them to a) apologise and get in line b) go public and complain about mistreatment and hijacked reforms. The later will serve as a pretext to eliminate them. The idea is, they will go public and speak to the media. Protests (encouraged by PP) erupts in parts of Oromia. The trio will be blamed for instigating conflict and killed. 
All in all, this was a distress call. A plea for understanding. The situation is dire. They are under enormous pressure. The source says the public must know that if something happens to any of these leaders, even if it's a "car accident," Abiy and PP will be responsible. These people are stuck. Arrest is the best they can hope for at this stage. The worst is feared as prison makes them martyrs and the issues will continue to linger. If they don't repent during this "temporary suspension," they will be eliminated. That's the fear. 
The official’’s final statement: “Speaking out is not an option now. Our survival is under a big question mark. It will also play into Abiy's hands. Our people should understand this. Please kana gurra uummata nuu buusii.”
