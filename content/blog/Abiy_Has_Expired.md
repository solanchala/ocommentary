Abiy Has Expired

==================

Abiy Ahmed has expired. His tenure is over. He is literally and utterly the past.

As far as the law is concerned, he is gone. (And there is no point now in saying, "#Abiy_must_go," unless you want to fight his ghost in an old battle.)
Now, the urgent task ahead of us is to set up transitional governments (both at the Federal and State levels, except in Tigray) that can coordinate actions towards conducting a democratic election on a short order.

The priority for all political leaders now is to take responsibility:

1. to arrest the deteriorating security situation, to stave off the looming anarchy, and to reverse the palpable threat of civil war;

2. to agree on a modest, workable roadmap for democratic transition; and 

3. to return the politics to the country's (and its States') constitutional sign posts.

To fail to do this is virtually to abdicate one's historic responsibility as political leaders. To not do this is to fail the people once more.
As for Oromia, the call by OLF to form a transitional government at the State level is a welcome gesture in the right direction, and all other political leaders and societal stakeholders need to respond to the call as urgently as possible.
But still, concrete measures need to be taken towards forming a government at least to:

a) keep the flow of public goods and services;

b) establish law and order; and

c) secure the region from neo-nafxanyaa forces that threaten to invade, break up, or otherwise destabilize the State.
