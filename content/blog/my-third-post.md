Yesterday, I asked Oromos to ask yourselves to use your skills and build it up enough to convince others to join your project.

Today, I ask you to also invest your time and resources into other projects that were sustainable enough to last a good amount of time or were productive. #WBO is a good example, sustained struggle that spanned generations. There could be loss or gain on your investment. Atleast take ownership and start exploring your options to invest your time or energy or resources.
Don't fight with those who are trying. Prove yourself by doing better, by working harder.
