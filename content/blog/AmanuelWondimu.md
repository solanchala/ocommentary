<hr>

Amanuel Wondimu Kebede was publicly executed by Oromia Special Forces on May 11, 2021 because the latter suspected him of being a member or supporter of 'Shanee'. He was barely 17. The special forces summoned more than a 1000 people to come and witness the public execution.
<br>
The communication bureau of Kellem Wollega zone of the Oromia regional state also bragged on its Facebook page with a message announcing that the city’s security forces have “captured and taken measures” on “a member of ‘Abba Torbe’,” a name associated with an armed group that operate under ‘Shene’, an organization recently designated as a “terrorist organization” by Ethiopia’s parliament.
<br>
The return of public execution in Ethiopia, carried out in cold blood, without any remorse, in front of spectators, in the city center, in Dembi Dollo. This is a public execution carried out not to end life but to extinguish an idea. The horrifying spectacle has the goal of warning Oromo youth and the people in the area that the authorities will kill with utmost savagery and zeal, with absolutely no regard to the law or the sanctity of the human life. This young man was in the hands of security forces and authorities could have held him accountable if he has committed a crime. There was no justification for this cowardly act.

{{< quote hashtags="JusticeforAmanuelWondimu" >}}Ethiopia's vast majority is in a state of active war. From Tigray to Oromo, to Afar to Benishangul Gumuz, Abiy Ahmed is killing us slowly in his bid to fulfill his promise to resurrect the imperial political vision against the multiculturalism.
